# Student Performance in Exams Data Analysis Project
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to answer a business question related to the performance of high school students in the United States in math, reading, and writing exams. Specifically, the question we aim to answer is:

"How can we explain and predict both math, reading and writing scores of high school students in the United States?"

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Student's Performance in Exams" dataset. The data is stored in a CSV file called "StudentsPerformance.csv".

## Data Application
The data application we have created for this project has three main components:

### Home Page
The home page provides access to all the dashboards we have created. Users can navigate to the exploratory dashboard and the results dashboard from this page.

### Exploratory Dashboard
The exploratory dashboard allows the user to explore the dataset in depth. The dashboard has a sidebar where the user can select different parameters to visualise the plots. The plots, including bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, etc., have been efficiently designed to give a relevant amount of information. Users can gain insights into the dataset by exploring the visualizations presented in the exploratory dashboard.

### Results Dashboard
The results dashboard presents the results of our analysis and provides an answer to the business question. We have used different machine learning algorithms/models such as regression, clustering, etc., to answer the question. The results dashboard is also interactive, with filters and widgets that enable users to adjust the visualizations and explore the results in depth.

## Conclusion
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance of high school students in the United States in math, reading, and writing exams. The exploratory dashboard allows users to explore the dataset, while the results dashboard presents our analysis and answer to the business question. We hope this project is informative and useful to the user.
